## Scripts

### `yarn watch`

Starts compilation in watch mode. This will recompile the typescript files into javascript
everytime you make a change to a typescript file. Recommended to run this in development.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the backend with nodemon. This matches well with `yarn watch` since you will ensure
you rerun the application everytime you make a change to a file.

### `yarn build`

Compile into javascript one time. Run this in production environments.
